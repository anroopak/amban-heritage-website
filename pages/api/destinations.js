                    It is located about 10 km from Thaliparamba in Kannur District. The deity worshiped in this temple is Sree Muthappan, a personification of two Gods – Thiruvappanan and Muthappan, who is said to have fought for the cause of the downtrodden and forsaken his entire life. His life is best portrayed through a traditional dance known as Muthappan Theyyam. Fish and toddy are the customary offerings to Muthappan and they are distributed here. The temple is also famous for Theyyam, a ritual art that is performed here on a daily basis.
